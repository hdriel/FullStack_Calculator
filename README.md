# FullStack_Calculator

### ElectronJS , angular , nodeJS, auth0, html, css

## Description

In this project, I wrote from a calculator that the user selects a number + operator + number, and the request is sent to the local server, where the server executes identification with auth0, and if a connection is created, then processes the post request and sends the response back to the client.

I added the theme when you click on the screen of the result, replacing from dark theme to bright and back.
I added an option to integer an entire phrase when you right-click the login button, which expands the calculator for further actions and entering an entire expression.
I added the option of pressing the buttons on the calculator using the keyboard.
I added unit test tests to client-side functions.

How to run the project is described in the pdf file in the project folder.
